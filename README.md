# C++ Simple Text Encryption Decryption
A simple text encryptor that given a text file and a seed, will insert a random number of random characters (including spaces) in between each character.

Make sure the text file you want to encrypt/decrypt is located in the same directory as the exe. Use the same seed for decryption as you did for encryption.
